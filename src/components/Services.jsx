                Join us for an intense 8-hour hackathon designed to push your limits in critical thinking and problem solving. Participants will face condensed real-world challenges that demand innovative coding and rapid decision-making. From the moment teams receive their carefully curated problem statements, the energy is palpable as everyone dives into a high-pressure coding sprint. Throughout the event, refreshing breaks provide time to recharge and network, while expert judges carry out two rounds of rigorous evaluation to ensure that every nuance of your solution is considered. As the final hours approach, teams refine their projects for compelling presentations, and then the moment of recognition arrives with the announcement of winners and prize awards. This immersive experience is not just about competing itâ€™s about showcasing your ability to transform challenges into breakthrough solutions.
